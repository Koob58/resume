In Short
--------

You have stumbled upon a passionate tinkerer, just look at my [github profile](http://github.com/maxim). I program for work and leisure (well, leisure sometimes involves silly things like making music, hiking, and backpacking). You know, the guy that keeps up with every single [Yehuda Katz](http://yehudakatz.com/) article and reads source code while consuming his morning cereal? The same guy that started hacking on Rails 3 before most people could get it to run? Yeah, that's me. I enjoy teaching as well as _learning_ from others, thus I'm sure we will have a lot to talk about. The thing is -- I hold it dear that we should be having fun, and principally strive for enjoyable partnership. Some of my attempts at teaching can be found on [my blog](http://mediumexposure.com). Oh, and I build web apps. A lot. In fact I'm working on two right now in my other OS X "spaces". I love building apps that solve real problems and/or help maintain lifestyles. On the other hand, maybe I'm just making excuses to do more tinkering.
